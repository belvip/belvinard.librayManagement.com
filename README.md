## System Overview üåç

This application is structured in multiple packages, each with a specific role to ensure that the system is modular, maintainable, and scalable.

## Packages & Classes üì¶

### `com.belvinard.libraryManagementSystem.model` - **Book Class**
- **Description**: This package contains the `Book` class, which represents the entity for books in the library system.
- **Attributes**: `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, `publicationYear`, `genre`
- **Validation**: Handles input validation, such as:
  - Ensuring the book title is at least 3 characters long.
  - Verifying that the `ISBN` is a 5-digit number.
  - Checking that the author's name contains only alphabetic characters.
- **Validation Example**: 
  - The title must have at least 3 characters.
  - The genre must be one of the predefined values (e.g., "Fiction", "Non-Fiction").

### `com.belvinard.libraryManagementSystem.data` - **LibraryData Class**
- **Description**: This package handles the collection of books. The `LibraryData` class stores a list of books and provides methods for managing the collection.
- **Functionality**: Adds books to the internal list, `bookCollection`.

### `com.belvinard.libraryManagementSystem.service` - **BookService Class**
- **Description**: This package contains the `BookService` class, which interacts with the data layer (`LibraryData`).
- **Functionality**: The service layer ensures separation of business logic (e.g., adding books) from the presentation layer.
- **Dependencies**: `LibraryData` is injected into `BookService` to handle book management.

### `com.belvinard.libraryManagementSystem.config` - **LibraryConfig Class**
- **Description**: This package sets up the Spring configuration, defining beans for `LibraryData` and `BookService`, making them available for dependency injection.
- **Functionality**: Uses `@Bean` annotations to define application configuration and manage dependencies between classes.

### `com.belvinard.libraryManagementSystem.console` - **ConsoleHandler Class**
- **Description**: This package contains the `ConsoleHandler` class, which provides user interaction via the console.
- **Functionality**: Displays the menu, takes user input, and calls relevant methods in `BookService` to perform actions like adding books.

### `com.belvinard.libraryManagementSystem` - **LibraryManagementSystemApplication Class**
- **Description**: The main entry point for the application, initializing the system and starting the console interface for user interaction.
