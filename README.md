### Skills Learned in the First Stage for Adding a Book

- 🔹 **Basic Java Object Creation**: Learned to create Java objects with attributes, including a constructor and parameterized constructors.
- 🔹 **Input Validation**: Developed custom setters with validation checks for attributes like `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, `genre`, and `publicationYear`.
- 🔹 **Exception Handling**: Implemented `IllegalArgumentException` for input errors, including meaningful error messages for each case.
- 🔹 **Using Regular Expressions**: Leveraged regular expressions (`Pattern.matches`) to validate text inputs, such as titles, authors, and ISBNs.
- 🔹 **Implementing Business Rules**: Enforced business rules (e.g., disallow duplicate ISBNs, validate specific genres).
- 🔹 **Console-Based User Interaction**: Built a simple, user-friendly console interface with input prompts and feedback messages.
- 🔹 **Data Storage with Collections**: Utilized `ArrayList` to store book objects in memory.
- 🔹 **Formatted Output with `toString()`**: Customized the `toString()` method to display book details in a readable format.
- 🔹 **Looping and Conditionals for Menu Navigation**: Used `while` loops and `switch` cases to manage user choices and keep the application running until the user exits.
- 🔹 **Error Handling for Duplicate Entries**: Created logic to check for existing ISBNs before adding a book and display appropriate error messages.

These skills provide a strong foundation for developing a robust book management system!

# Skills Learned During the "Display All Books" Stage 📚

## General Programming Skills
- ✅ **Creating and Using Getter Methods**: Learned to expose private fields safely using public getter methods.
- ✅ **Iterating Over Collections**: Practiced iterating over a list of objects (`List<Book>`) to display each item.
- ✅ **Testing Application Features**: Verified the functionality of methods through manual testing and debugging.

## Java-Specific Skills
- 🛠 **Working with Java Collections**: Used `ArrayList` and `List` to store and retrieve objects.
- 🛠 **Implementing Methods in Classes**: Added specific methods in the `LibraryData` and `BookService` classes to support functionality.
- 🛠 **Encapsulation and Data Access**: Applied the principle of encapsulation to protect data and expose it through well-defined interfaces.

## Spring Framework Skills
- 🌱 **Defining Components**: Utilized `@Component` to define Spring-managed beans for dependency injection.
- 🌱 **Managing Dependencies**: Connected `LibraryData` and `BookService` components in a structured manner.

## Debugging and Problem-Solving Skills
- 🐛 **Resolving "Cannot Find Symbol" Errors**: Identified and fixed missing method definitions by adding the required getter.
- 🐛 **Refining Logic**: Adjusted the code to correctly retrieve and display stored books.
- 🐛 **Testing Edge Cases**: Ensured that no duplicate books with the same ISBN were displayed.

## Console-Based UI Skills
- 💻 **Designing User Menus**: Created a user-friendly console menu to display book options.
- 💻 **Output Formatting**: Enhanced readability of book details using `toString()` formatting in the `Book` class.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
- 📦 **Separation of Concerns**: Separated data handling, business logic, and presentation layers into distinct classes.
- 📦 **Reusable Methods**: Designed a reusable `displayAllBooks` method in `ConsoleHandler`.

## Communication and Validation
- 📢 **Meaningful Output Messages**: Displayed clear messages for users, such as success notifications and book details.
- 📢 **Edge Case Handling**: Ensured that the application gracefully handled invalid data.
